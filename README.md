# Movie_recommender_system
# This is a content based movie reecommender system in which I have used TMDB dataset from kaggle
# The dataset contains two files movies.csv and credits.csv
# I've used data cleaning and preprocessing techniques in order to create appropriate tags which we can use in our dataset
# I've also used TMDB api to fetch movie posters with respect to movie id's of the dataset.
# I've created a venv in python and also used stamlit to run the app on a localhost
# Tools used: Python- Pandas,Numpy, Exporatory Data Analysis,Machine Learning library- Sklearn - count Veactorizer,cosine simialarity , NLP lib. - Nltk library - portstemmer.
# used pickle library in order to dump and create pickle file (.pkl)
